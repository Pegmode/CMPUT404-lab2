Q1:     when creating a socket object, you specify the type in the constructor
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket
        It is listed as "type". SOCK_STREAM specifies TCP, SOCK_DGRAM specifies UDP

Q2:     A client socket has to connect to a particular IP address and port
        A server socket has to be set up and bound. It only needs to specify a port
        and can receive connection from any IP address

Q3:     using the SO_REUSEADDR flag with socket.setsockopt()
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#example last example explains this

Q4:     incoming connection's IP Address is given by the 2nd value 
        of the touple given by  socket.socket.accept(). We can also get
        the port but this is already known implicity from binding the socket

Q5:     for the client, after sending an HTTP request recv() returns the servers
        response to the HTTP request. (This question is worded slightly strange)
